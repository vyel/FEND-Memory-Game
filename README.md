## About the Project

The [starter project code](https://github.com/udacity/fend-project-memory-game) had some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. We had to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This required modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

## How to Play

Click the cards to reveal the hidden character. The goal is to match the cards with the fewest possible moves.

The more moves you make, the less stars you gain:

* less than 13 Moves - 3 stars
* less than 18 Moves - 2 stars
* 18 Moves or more - 1 star

The game ends when all cards are matched, or you can restart the game by clicking on the restart button.

## Dependencies / Resources

* Card Icons: [FlatIcon - Roundicons Freebies's Pokemon Go set](https://www.flaticon.com/packs/pokemon-go)
* Rating Icons: [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)
